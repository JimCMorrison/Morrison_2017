	      <h2><b><u>Education</u></b></h2>
	      <p>I received my formal education from DeVry University at their Bakersfield campus. I attended and completed courses for a Bachelors Degree in Computer Information Systems starting in July 2009 and finished in December 2013. During my studies I was taught standard programming concepts and trained how to implement them using a variety of programming languages. I continue to push my learning through personal development projects, writing developer focused <%= link_to "Medium articles", 'https://medium.com/@CodingMorrison' %>, along with monthly JavaScript meetups!</p>

	      <h2><b><u>Experience</u></b></h2>
	      <p>I am a scrappy, motivated Web Developer who is forging development adventures through the wild world of the internet! I spend my work week at Superior Court of California working as a Programmer/Systems Analyst crafting positive experiences through development projects. With my nights jumping between React, Redux, and Ruby on Rails building a unique developer tool belt. When I am not hand crafting code line by line I am spending time with my incredible wife and two wonderful daughters, devouring all things Game Of Thrones, and driving around my ramshackled 240sx!</p>
